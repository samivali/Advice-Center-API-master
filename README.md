About
I built this project because I found that a lot of people ive talked to have trouble meeting with thier councilors and I wanted to make a place where people could get their questions answered.

Answer these questions: What is your project? Why'd you build it?

Goal and requirements
Goal:
Fully functional website
questions and responses
Visually appealing

Commenting on answered questions
Accounts
Editing questions once submitted
videos/pictures in comments/questions

Sprint Goal
In the last 2 weeks of this project I would like to complete the response to questions through email and the posting of the responses as well as applying the style sheets and I want to hold off on posting the website because there are somethings that I want improve before this.

Key learnings
I learned alot about how to research and figure out problems im having. As well as learning more about webdev and how building a website on a time line actually works.

Running your project
When im done Im hoping to get it up on a website hosting service.

How would I, or anyone who comes across this project, run this project? Make sure to include all the steps.
